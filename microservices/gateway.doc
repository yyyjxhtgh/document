Spring Gateway:

1.	SSL:

The Gateway can listen for requests on https by following the usual Spring server configuration.  The following configuration will allow gateway has ssl enabled

Dev:
server:
     ssl:
         enabled-protocols: TLSv1.2
         key-alias: tomcat
         key-store: /opt/wt/TAS/IQ/cert/keystore.p12
         key-store-password: changeit
         key-store-provider: SunJSSE
         key-store-type: PKCS12
         protocol: TLS
         trust-store: /opt/wt/TAS/IQ/cert/cacerts.p12
         trust-store-password: changeit
  trust-store-type: PKCS12

2.	Trust store for routes endpoints:
Gateway routes can be routed to both http and https backends. If routing to a https backend then the Gateway can be configured to trust all downstream certificates with the following configuration:
a.	Add trust-store info  (see 1 which has been added)
b.	Add the following configuration:
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      httpclient:
        ssl:
          useInsecureTrustManager: true



Using an insecure trust manager is not suitable for production. For a production deployment the Gateway can be configured with a set of known certificates that it can trust with the follwing configuration:
application.yml. 
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      httpclient:
        ssl:
          trustedX509Certificates:
          - cert1.pem
          - cert2.pem
If the Spring Cloud Gateway is not provisioned with trusted certificates the default trust store is used (which can be overriden with system property javax.net.ssl.trustStore).

3.	TLS handshake timeout

The Gateway maintains a client pool that it uses to route to backends. When communicating over https the client initiates a TLS handshake. A number of timeouts are assoicated with this handshake. These timeouts can be configured (defaults shown):
application.yml. 
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      httpclient:
        ssl:
          handshake-timeout-millis: 10000
          close-notify-flush-timeout-millis: 3000
          close-notify-read-timeout-millis: 0

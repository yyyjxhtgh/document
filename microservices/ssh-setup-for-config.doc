For config server which talks to github for its application yaml files, we need to setup ssh keys so config sever can communicate with github
The pub key needs to be set in github for the repo it tries to reach.

Config ssh for config server:

1.	Check if existing SSH keys are present

$ ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist

We can use existing public and private key pair. However, a new key is recommended.

2.	Generating public/private rsa key pair:  

 $ ssh-keygen      

Choose default setting and no passphrase.
$ ls ~/.ssh
id_rsa id_rsa.pub
The command displays two files, one for the public key (for example id_rsa.pub) and one for the private key (for example, id_rsa).

3.	Add the key to the ssh-agent
If you don't want to type your password each time you use the key, you'll need to add it to the ssh-agent.

To start the agent, run the following for windown:

$ eval `ssh-agent`

:
Agent pid 9700

In load env vi  it is eval $(ssh-agent)


$ ssh-add  ~/.ssh/<private_<private_key_file>     //id_rsa

4.	Open public key and copy the value  (it should be begin with rsa..)  to github.
vi ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
https://github.worldpay.com/Worldpay/iq-service-configurations
	Settings   Deploy keys  Add ne deploy keys  paste

5.	Verify the connection
$ ssh -T git@github.worldpay.com


Additional info:

Find the key where is used:

ssh -T -ai ~/.ssh/id_rsa git@github.worldpay.com

1.	Use app2 as an example

2.	Copy all dependencies including dev dependencies from admin package.json to app2  (see attachment)


3.	Add the following in package.json
"scripts": {
    "postinstall": "ngcc"        //I added this in the first line.
  }

4.	Deleted node_modules for app2

5.	Deleted package-lock file

6.	Change import singleSpaAngular from 'single-spa-angular' in main.single-spa.ts to import {singleSpaAngular} from 'single-spa-angular';            //The build seems giving compiling error without {}  @Pan, Ron
7.	Copy required admin code “app” folder.   //I removed the existing one.

8.	Copy other admin required folders under src      // By doing so I tried to avoid any typo or mistakes.

9.	Simplify  Style.css under src to remove any imports  // By doing so I tried to avoid any style dependencies from original app2.   It complains if the style.css file is not there though.

10.	Run npm install

11.	Run npm build

12.	Run ng serve --disable-host-check --port 4202 --deploy-url http://localhost:4202/ --live-reload false

13.	You can see http://localhost:4202/main.js which will be loaded by the shell app running on 4200.

14.	When I navigate from shell to admin there are some app exceptions on console:  ERROR Error: No base href set. Please provide a value for the APP_BASE_HREF token or add a base element to the document.  I will assume it is app config related issues.  You can take a look.
